## Matrix Multiplication on Map-Reduce

### Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple program for graph processing using Apache Hive.

In this project, you are asked to write a Apache Pig script to compute graph neighboring nodes. A directed graph is represented as a text file where each line represents a graph edge. For example,

20,40

represents the directed edge from node 20 to node 40. First, for each graph node, you compute the number of node neighbors. Then, you group the nodes by their number of neighbors and for each group you count how many nodes belong to this group. That is, the result will have lines such as:

10 30

which says that there are 30 nodes that have 10 neighbors.

### Compile & Running

// Compile Graph.hql using:

```java
hive -f graph.hql --hiveconf G=small-graph.txt
```

// and run Graph.java in standalone mode over a small dataset using:

hive -f graph.hql --hiveconf G=small-graph.txt &>graph.local.out

```java
2 2
3 2
4 1
5 2
7 1
```

// and run Graph.java in distributed mode  using:

```java
sbatch graph.distr.run
```

This will process the graph on the large dataset large-graph.txt and will write the result in the directory output-distr. These results should be similar to the results in the file large-solution.txt. 

Results generated by the program will be in the directory output-distr.
