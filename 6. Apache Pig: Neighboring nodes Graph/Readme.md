## Matrix Multiplication on Map-Reduce


### Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple program for graph processing using Apache Pig.

In this project, you are asked to write a Apache Pig script to compute graph neighboring nodes. A directed graph is represented as a text file where each line represents a graph edge. For example,

20,40

represents the directed edge from node 20 to node 40. First, for each graph node, you compute the number of node neighbors. Then, you group the nodes by their number of neighbors and for each group you count how many nodes belong to this group. That is, the result will have lines such as:

10 30

which says that there are 30 nodes that have 10 neighbors.

### Compile & Running

Compile Multiply.java using:

```java
run graph.build
2 2
3 2
4 1
5 2
7 1
```


The results generated by your program will be in the directory output. These results should be:

```java
sbatch graph.distr.run
```

This will process the graph on the large dataset large-graph.txt and will write the result in the directory output-distr. These results should be similar to the results in the file large-solution.txt. 

Results generated by the program will be in the directory output-distr. 

##### Pseudo-Code

```java

// The first Map-Reduce is:

Pig script, you can access the path of the input graph as '$G' and the output path as '$O'. That is, you can use LOAD '$G' USING ..., to load the graph and STORE X INTO '$O' ..., to write the relation X to the output directory.
```

]

```

and you can run Graph.java in standalone mode over a small dataset using:

```java
sbatch graph.local.run
```

Results generated by the program will be in the directory output. These results should be:

```java
